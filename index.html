  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is Alejandro Reyes; friends and family call me Alex or Ale. I would preferably like to  be called Alex. This is my second semester being a student at Cerritos College;  my major at the moment is Computer Science. I would like to learn how to better manage my time; to build strong study habits. I want to become involved with individuals with the same interests as me; while discovering my passion and where my skills are best suited.</p>
  <h3>Things I love to do in my free time:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I enjoy working out with my brother.</li>
    <li>I love spending time with my nephew.</li>
    <li>I enjoy cruising through the streets of my city during late nights with my skateboard while listening to music on my headphones.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here's a link to my favorite website: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a></p> 
  <p>I enjoy to sharpen up my skills and practice problems. Sometimes I leave feeling overwhelmed or phenomenally willed.</p>
